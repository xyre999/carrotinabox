Carrot in a BOX


This is a simple and silly bluffing game for two human players. Each player has a box. One box has a carrot in it, and each player wants to have the carrot. The first player looks in their box and then tells the second player they either do or donâ€™t have the carrot. The second player gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.
